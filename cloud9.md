#Cloud9
###What is CLoud9?
- Cloud9 is an online indegrated development environment (IDE) that supports hundreds of programming languages including, you guessed it... RUBY! 
- If you choose to sign up for the full 10 week course, you will configure your IDE on your computer and use your terminal and a text editor, but for now Cloud9 will definitely do the trick.
