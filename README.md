#Coder.new Coding Environment Setup

We need to setup your "coding environment" on your local computer, meaning, we need to download and configure a few things to make sure you are ready to write your code effectively starting day 1. It's important to follow the instructions in the order of the list below and make sure to pay careful attention to make sure the commands used are exactly the same as they are written in each of the documents linked below.
#####1. We are going to download and set up Xcode, the IDE (integrated development environment) containing tons of software development tools used by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. Follow the instructions in the [xcode.md](https://github.com/Coderdotnew/getting_started/blob/master/xcode.md) file inside this Github repository.
#####2. Follow the instructions in the [github.md](https://github.com/Coderdotnew/getting_started/blob/master/github.md) file inside this Github repository (md just stands for markdown, a lightweight markup language to format and edit plain text). If you took the free coding session with us or already have a Github account and you know the login credentials, skip to the section that directs you to http://git-scm.com/ which will require you to already have Github login credentials created.
#####3. Next, we need to make sure we have the latest version of Ruby installed in Xcode. Head to the [ruby.md](https://github.com/Coderdotnew/getting_started/blob/master/ruby.md) file to get Ruby setup.
#####4. Time to download the text editor we will be using, Sublime! Sublime Text Editor has many languages included to make coding easier and cleaner than ever (which you will soon learn). Follow the download instructions in the [sublime.md](https://github.com/Coderdotnew/getting_started/blob/master/sublime.md) file.
#####5. Slack is an awesome communication tool that let's you have direct messaging as well as numerous group chats in different channels. It is used by many popular startups today as the primary means of communication. We will send you an email invite to the Coder.new Slack channel after the first coding session!
#####6. If you have any questions questions about the coding session, feel free to email michael@coderdotnew.com
